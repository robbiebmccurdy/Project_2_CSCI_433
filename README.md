# Project_2_CSCI_433
 Project 2 for CSCI 433 (Algorithms). This project takes in three arguements, the name of the sort method (merge, selection, etc), the number of arrays, and the size of each array. It then sorts it based on the sort you've called and calculates the time in nanoTime for how long the sorting took.
